        		<h1>PROJECT 1 : BAD AIR</h1>
			
			<h3>Motivation:</h3>
			<p>Motivation behind this project was to enable users to understand the air quality index in different counties accross United states. Users should also be able to select any two counties and compare the quality of air with respect to different mesurements. </p>
			<h3>Data:</h3>
			<p>The data used in the project was collected by <a href = https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data> EPA </a> and is publicly available <a href = https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual>here</a>. The AirData website gives you access to air quality data collected at outdoor monitors across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The data fields which were used to calculate various measures and are being used in the project includes maximum, 90th percentile and median AQI, the count of days in each AQI category, and the count of days when the AQI could be attributed to each criteria pollutant.</p>
			<h3>Visualization Componenets:</h3>
			<ul>
        			<li>Line Chart 1</a></li><p>Enables users to visualize air quality in slected counties based on max AQI, median and 90th percentile</p>
                		<li>Line Chart 2</a></li><p>Enables users to visualize air quality in slected counties based on max AQI, median and 90th percentile</p>
                		<li>Line Chart 3</a></li><p>Enables users to visualize percentage of days when the selcted pollutant is dominant in the slected counties</p>
				<li>Bar Chart 1</a></li><p>Enables users to visualize the percentage of days where the AQI was good / moderate / unhealthy for sensitive / unhealthy / very unhealthy / hazardous for Hamilton, Ohio</p>
                		<li>Bar Chart 2</a></li><p>Enables users to visualize the number of days in each year without a measurement [NEED A FIX!]</p>
